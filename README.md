## Introduction

Dr. ROBOT is a tool for **Domain Reconnaissance and Enumeration**. By utilizing containers to reduce the overhead of dealing with dependencies, inconsistency across operating sytems, and different languages, Dr. ROBOT is built to be highly portable and configurable.

**Use Case**: Gather as many public facing servers that a target organization possesses. Querying DNS resources enables us to quickly develop a large list of possible targets that you can run further analysis on.

**Note**: Dr. ROBOT is not just a one trick pony. You can easily customize the tools that are used gather information, so that you can enjoy the benefits of using latest and greatest along with your battle tested favorites.

### List of current tools

* Altdns
* Amass
* Anubis
* Aquatone (Discover portion, when aquatone had multiple parts)
* CT-Exposer
* CTFR
* Eyewitness
* HTTPScreenshot
* Knock
* NMap Screenshot
* NMap 
* Reconng 
* Subbrute
* Subfinder
* Sublist3r
* Webscreenshot

## Config Files

DrROBOT adds config files, templates, logs, output files, and db files to your $HOME directory under ```.drrobot```

The directory structure will look like this:

```

-rw-r--r--   1       0 Sep 16 12:15 ansible_inventory
drwxr-xr-x   5     160 Sep 16 12:18 ansible_plays
-rw-r--r--   1   13576 Sep 16 12:41 config.json
drwxr-xr-x   4     128 Sep 17 10:48 dbs
drwxr-xr-x  21     672 Sep 16 13:51 docker_buildfiles
drwxr-xr-x   4     128 Sep 16 15:38 logs
drwxr-xr-x   3      96 Sep 16 12:46 output
```

If you ever break your config beyond saving you can delete the config.json file in your $HOME directory and rerun drrobot, which will generate a new config file for you.

## Configuration

DrROBOT is meant to be added on to. To add tools to DrROBOT you there are **three** things you can do:

#### Important

To make sure no issues come from adding your own tool make sure the key used to identify a json item, the name, and docker_name are all unique. 

### 1. Docker container

Using the config file found under **$HOME/.drrobot/config.json** you can use the other modules as a template. For this example I am using the Amass tool in the config file.

```
        "Amass": {
            "name": "Amass",
            "default" : false,
            "mode" : "DOCKER",
            "network_mode": "host",
            "docker_name" : "amass",
            "default_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Amass.tmp",
            "active_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Amass",
            "description": "The OWASP Amass tool suite obtains subdomain names by scraping data sources, recursive brute forcing, crawling web archives, permuting/altering names and reverse DNS sweeping.",
            "src": "https://github.com/OWASP/Amass",
            "output": "/root/amass",
            "output_folder": "amass"
        },
```

To add your own tool you can simply replace the above data as necessary with your tools information. 

Now add a Dockerfile under the docker_buildfiles under **$HOME/.drrobot/docker_buildfiles**. Simply follow the naming scheme for default and active conf when creating your file. 

```
FROM golang:1.12.6-alpine3.10 as build
RUN apk --no-cache add git
RUN go get github.com/OWASP/Amass; exit 0

ENV GO111MODULE on

WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/OWASP/Amass

RUN go install ./...

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=build /go/bin/amass /bin/amass
COPY --from=build /go/src/github.com/OWASP/Amass/wordlists/ /wordlists/

ENV http_proxy $proxy
ENV https_proxy $proxy
ENV DNS $dns
ENV HOME /

RUN mkdir -p $output

ENV TARGET $target
ENV OUTPUT $output/amass.txt
ENV INFILE  $infile

ENTRYPOINT amass enum --passive -d "$target" -o $$OUTPUT
```

As you can see there are some ENV variables that we pass in when running our tool. If you have any specific ones that you would like to pass into the docker container you can add them to the above JSON under a name which you will then reference in the Dockerfile. For example you will notice **$output** is used. **$output** comes from the above json blob and is then replaced during the runtime of DrROBOT.



### 2. Ansible Playbook

Similar to adding a Docker container we first add our tool to the configuration file. 

```
        "HTTPScreenshot": {
            "name" : "HTTPScreenshot",
            "short_name" : "http",
            "mode" : "ANSIBLE",
            "ansible_arguments" : {
                "config" : "$config/httpscreenshot_play.yml",
                "flags": "-e '$extra' -i configs/ansible_inventory",
                "extra_flags":{
                    "1" : "variable_host=localhost",
                    "2" : "variable_user=user", 
                    "3" : "infile=$infile",
                    "4" : "outfile=$outdir/httpscreenshots.tar",
                    "5" : "outfolder=$outdir/httpscreenshots"
                }
            },
            "description" : "Post enumeration tool for screen grabbing websites. All images will be downloaded to outfile: httpscreenshot.tar and unpacked httpscreenshots",
            "output" : "/tmp/output",
            "infile" : "/tmp/output/aggregated/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",
        },
```

Take special note of the **ansible_arguments**. The two required items are **config** and **flags**. These two items tell DrROBOT what file to use and what inventory and flags will be used. **extra flags** is a nested JSON block where you can specify any parameters that need to go into the ansible playbook.

Note: 

* **$infile** comes from the outermost **infile** so that it is consistent for both docker and ansible. You can use a full path to a file for input if you desire.
* **$outdir** comes from DrROBOT. It will develop a path that points to your **$HOME/.drrobot/output/<domain>/**. Again, you can specify a custom path if you like. 

#### The Playbook

This will simply be a standard playbook with a few changes so that DrROBOT can use the parameters we fed it. To make sure a parameter that we specified in the "extra_flags" JSON blob is available you can use the Ansible syntax for variables: ```"{ variable_name|quote }}"``` (Note the *quote* helps prevent issues with variable names)

```
---
- hosts: "{{ variable_host|quote }}"
  remote_user: "{{ variable_user|quote }}" 

  tasks:
      - name: Apt install git
        become: true
...
```



### 3. Web Module

Again we start with the config.json. For web modules you will be writing Python code that DrROBOT can leverage for domain enumeration. As before the names must be unique, however, for Web Modules the **class_name** must exactly match the class name inside web_resource.py.

```
        "Dumpster" :
        {
            "short_name" : "dump",
            "class_name" : "Dumpster",
            "default" : false,
            "description" : "Use the limited response of DNSDumpster. Requires API access for better results.",
            "output_file" : "dumpster.txt"
        },
```

#### The Module

DrROBOT will use the JSON input to load classes at runtime which allows us to run your custom code! To add your custom code to the web_resource.py file there are some caveats:

1. It must extend the WebTool abstract base class. This allos DrROBOT to treat all imported classes as the same and run the only method we require: **do_query**.
2. If you want your output to be written to the correct folder you will store your results under the **self.results** list and call **_write_results** which will write to the output_file in your config.json.
