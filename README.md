## Introduction

Dr. ROBOT is a tool for **Domain Reconnaissance and Enumeration**. By utilizing containers to reduce the overhead of dealing with dependencies, inconsistency across operating sytems, and different languages, Dr. ROBOT is built to be highly portable and configurable.

**Use Case**: Gather as many public facing servers that a target organization possesses. Querying DNS resources enables us to quickly develop a large list of possible targets that you can run further analysis on.

**Note**: Dr. ROBOT is not just a one trick pony. You can easily customize the tools that are used gather information, so that you can enjoy the benefits of using latest and greatest along with your battle tested favorites.

**Install and Run**

    ```

**MAIN**

```buildoutcfg
usage: drrobot.py [-h] [--proxy PROXY] [--dns DNS] [--verbose]
                  [--dbfile DBFILE]
                  {gather,inspect,upload,rebuild,dumpdb,output,serve}
                  ...

Docker DNS recon tool

positional arguments:
  {gather,inspect,upload,rebuild,dumpdb,output,serve}
    gather              Run scanners against a specified domain and gather the associated
                        systems. You have the option to run using any
                        docker_buildfiles/webtools included in your config.
    inspect             Run further tools against domain information gathered
                        from the gather step. Note: you must either supply a file
                        which contains a list of IP/Hostnames, or the targeted
                        domain must have a db file in the dbs folder
    upload              Upload recon data to Mattermost. Currently only works
                        with afolder that contain PNG images.
    rebuild             Rebuild the database with additional files/all files
                        from the previous runtime
    dumpdb              Dump the database of ip, hostname, and banners to a text
                        file
    output              Generate output in specified format. Contains all
                        information from scans (images, headers, hostnames,

## Configurations

This tool is highly dependent on the configuration you provide it. Provided for you is a **default_config.json** that you can use as a simple template for your **user_config.json**. Most of the configurations under **Scanners** are done for you and can be used as is. Note the use of **default** in this and other sections.

> default : specifies a Docker or Ansible instance. Make sure you adjust configurations according to their usage. 

* Docker Configuration Requirements
    * Example:

        ```json
        "Sublist3r": {
            "name": "Sublist3r",
            "default" : true,
            "mode" : "DOCKER",
            "docker_name": "sub",
            "network_mode": "host",
            "default_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Sublist3r.tmp",

            "src": "https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r",
            "output": "/root/sublist3r",
            "output_folder": "sublist3r"
        },
        
        ```

        

    * name: Identifiable name for the program/utility you are using
    * default : (Disabled for now) 
    * mode : DOCKER (uses docker container with this tool when chosen)
    * docker_name : What the docker image name will be when running ```docker images```
    * network_mode : Network mode to use when creating container. Host uses the host network
    * default_conf : Template Dockerfile to build form
    * active_conf : Target specific configuration that will be used during runtime
    * description : Description of tool (optional)
    * src : Where the tool comes from (optional)
    * output : Location of output on the docker container. Can be hardcoded into Dockerfiles for preference
    * output_folder : Location under the *outputs/target* folder where output for target will be stored


* Ansible Configuration Requirements
    * Example
    ```json
        "HTTPScreenshot": {
            "name" : "HTTPScreenshot",
            "short_name" : "http",
            "mode" : "ANSIBLE",
            "ansible_arguments" : {
                "config" : "$config/httpscreenshot_play.yml",
                "flags": "-e '$extra' -i ansible_plays/inventory.yml",
                "extra_flags":{
                    "1" : "variable_host=localhost",
                    "2" : "infile=$infile/aggregated/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",
                    "3" : "outfile=$outfile/httpscreenshots.tar",
                    "4" : "outfolder=$outfile/httpscreenshots",
                    "5" : "variable_user=bitnami"
                }
            },
            "description" : "Post enumeration tool for screen grabbing websites. All images will be downloaded to outfile: httpscreenshot.tar and unpacked httpscreenshots",
            "output" : "/tmp/output",
            "infile" : "/tmp/output/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",
            "enabled" : false
    ```
    * name: Identifiable name for the program/utility you are using
    * default : (Disabled for now) 
    * mode : ANSIBLE (uses Ansible with this tool when chosen)
    * ansible_arguments : Json configuration for specific informaiton
        * config : playbook to use ($config keyword is replaces for full path to file when issuing ansible playbook command)
        * flags : specifies extra flags to be used with the ansible command (specifically useful for any extra flags you would like to use)
        * extra flags : key does not matter so long as it is different from any other key. These extra flags will all be applied to the ansible file in question
    * description : Description of tool (optional)
    * src : Where the tool comes from (optional)
    * output : Where output will be stored on the external file system
    * infile : (Unique for certain modules) what files this program will use as input to the program. In this case you will notice that it searches /tmp/output for aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt. This file is supplied from the above extra flags option.

* Web Modules
    * Example:
    ```json
            "HackerTarget" :
        {
            "short_name" : "hack",
            "class_name" : "HackerTarget",
            "default" : false,
            "description" : "This query will display the forward DNS records discovered using the data sets outlined above.",
            "api_call_unused" : "https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=example.com",
            "output_file" : "hacker.txt"
        },
    ```
    * short_name : quick reference name for use in CLI
    * class_name : this must match the name you specify for a given class under the respective module name
        * The reason behind this results from the loading of modules at runtime which requires the use of importlib. This will load the respective class from the classname provided via the CLI options.
    * default : false (Disabled for now)
    * api_call_unused : (Old, may be used later...)
    * description : Description of tool (optional)

* Serve Module:
    * Example
    ```json

    * active_conf : Target specific configuration that will be used during runtime
    * description : Description of tool (optional)
    * ports: Port mapping of localhost to container for docker



### Example Configuration For WebTools

Under **configs**, you will find a default_config that contains a majority of the default scanners you can use. If you wish to extend upon the **WebTools** list just follow these steps:

1. Add the new tool to the user_config.json

   ```json
   {
     "WebTools":
     {
       "NewTool" :
       {
         "short_name": "ntool",
         "class_name": "NewTool",
         "description" : "NewTool description",
         "output_file" : "newtool.txt",
         "api_key" : null,
         "endpoint" : null,
         "username" : null,
         "password" : null
       },
   ```

2. Open **src/web_resources.py** and make a class with the **class_name** specified in the previous step. ***MAKE SURE IT MATCHES EXACTLY***

   ```python
   class NewTool(WebTool):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        ....
    def do_query(self):
        .... do the query ... 
        store results in
        self.results
   ```

### Example Configurations For Docker Containers

Under **configs**, you will find a **default_config** which contains a majority of the default scanners you can utilize. If you wish to extend upon the **Scanners** list just follow these steps:

1. Add the **json** to the **config** file (user if generated).

   ```json
   "Scanners" : {
    ...
       "NewTool": {
           "name": "NewTool",
           "default" : true, 
           "mode" : DOCKER,
           "docker_name": "ntool",
           "network_mode": "host",
           "default_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.NewTool.tmp",
           "active_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.NewTool",
           "description": "NewTool is an awesome tool for domain enumeration",
           "src": "https://github.com/NewTool",
           "output": "/home/newtool",
           "output_file": "NewTool.txt"
         },
         ...
   }
   ```
   1. Note *network_mode* is an option specifically for docker containers. It is implementing the 
      ``` --network ``` flag when using docker

2. Under the **docker_buildfiles/** folder, create your **Dockerfile.NewTool.tmp** dockerfile.

   1. If you desire adding more options at run time to the Dockerfiles, look at editing **src/dockerize**
   2. **Note:** As of right now Dockerfiles must come from the **docker_buildfiles** folder. Future work includes specifying a remote source for the docker images. 

### Example Ansible Configuration

Under **configs** you will find a **default_config** which contains a majority of the default scanners you can have. For this step however, we will be looking at configuring an inspection too **Eyewitness** for utilization with **Ansible**.

1. Add the **json** to the **config** file (user if generated).

   ```json
   "Enumeration" : {
           "Eyewitness": {
               "name" : "Eyewitness",
               "short_name" : "eye",
               "docker_name" : "eye",
               "mode" : "ANSIBLE",
               "network_mode": "host",
               "default_conf" : "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Eyewitness.tmp",
               "active_conf" : "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Eyewitness",
               "ansible_arguments" : {
                   "config" : "$config/eyewitness_play.yml",
                   "flags": "-e '$extra' -i ansible_plays/inventory",
                   "extra_flags":{
                       "1" : "variable_host=localhost",
                       "2" : "variable_user=root",
                       "3" : "infile=$infile/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",
                       "4" : "outfile=$outfile/Eyewitness.tar",
                       "5" : "outfolder=$outfile/Eyewitness"
                   }
               },
               "description" : "Post enumeration tool for screen grabbing websites. All images will be downloaded to outfile: Eyewitness.tar and unpacked in Eyewitness",
               "output" : "/tmp/output",
               "infile" : "/tmp/output/aggregated/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",
               "enabled" : false
           },
   }
   ```

2. As you can see, this has a few items that may seem confusing at first, but will be clarified here:

   1. mode: Allows you to specify how you want to deploy a tool you want to use. Currently **DOCKER** or **ANSIBLE** are the only available methods to deploy.

   2. All options outside of **ansible_configuration** will be ignored when developing for **ANSIBLE**.

   3. Options under *ansible_arguments*

      1. **config**: specify which playbook to use

      2. **flags**: which flags to pass to the **ansible-playbook** command. With the exception of the **$extra** flag, you can add anything you would like to be done uniquely here.

      3. **extra_flags** : this corresponds to the **$extra** flag as seen above. This will be used to populate variables that you input into your playbook. You can use this to supply command line arguments when utilizing ansible and Dr. Robot in order to add files and other utilities to your script. 

         1.  **variable_host** : hostname alias found in the inventory file
         2.  **variable_user** : user to login as on the variable_host machine
         3.  **infile**: file to be used with the tool above. Eyewitness requires hostnames with the format ```https://some.url```, hence *aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt* 
            1.  Note the use of the prefix **$infile**- these names all match as they are placeholders for the default locations that **$infile** corresponds to in **outputs/target_name/aggregated**
            2.  If you have a file in another location you can just specify the entire path without any errors occurring.
         4.  **outfile** : The output file location 
            1.  As with the above infile **$outfile** in the name is just a key to the location **outputs/target_name/**
            2.  You may specify a hard coded path for other use. Just remember the location for uploading or other processing with Dr. Robot
         5.  **outfolder** : The output folder to unpack/download files too
            1.  As with the above infile **$outfile** in the name is just a key to the location **outputs/target_name/**
            2.  This is a special case for Eyewitness and HttpScreenshot, which you can see in their playbooks. They generate a lot of files and rather than download each individually having them pack up the files as a step in the playbook and then unpacking allows for some integrity.
         6.  A quick example below shows how we use the **extra_flags** to supply the hostname to the playbook for ansible.

         ```yaml
         ---
         - hosts: "{{ variable_host|quote }}"
           remote_user: root 
         
           tasks:
               - name: Apt install git
                 become: true
                 apt:
                     name: git
                     force: yes
         ```

         

### Docker Integration and Customization

Docker is relied upon heavily for this tool to function.

All Docker files will have a **default_conf** and an **active_conf**. 

**<u>default_conf</u>** represents the template that will be used for generation of the docker files. The reason for building the docker images is to allow for finer control on the user end, especially if you are in a more restricted environment without access to the docker repositories.

**<u>active_conf</u>** represents the configuration which will be build into the current image.

**example Dockerfile.tmp**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.4

WORKDIR /home
ENV http_proxy $proxy
ENV https_proxy $proxy
ENV DNS $dns
ENV TARGET $target
ENV OUTPUT $output

RUN mkdir -p $$OUTPUT

RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; apt-get install git

RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git /home/sublist

WORKDIR /home/sublist

RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; pip3 install -r requirements.txt

ENTRYPOINT python3 sublist3r.py --domain $target -o $output/sublist3r.txt
```

We use **ENV** to keep track of most variable input from Python on the user end.

Using the **DNS** information provided by the user we are able to download packages and git repos during building. 

### Ansible Configuration

Please see the ansible documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/ for details on how to develop a playbook for use with DrRobot. 

#### Inventory

Ansible inventory files will be self contained within DrRobot so as to further seperate itself from any one system. The inventory file will be located under **configs/ansible_inventory**

As noted in the documentation ansible inventory can be defined as groups or single IP's. A quick example:

```yaml
[example-host]
ip.example.com
```

#### SSH + Ansible

If you desire to run Ansible with this tool and require ssh authentication be done you can use the application as is to run Ansible scripts. The plays will be piped to STDIN/STDOUT so that you may supply credentials if required. 

If you wish to have to not manually provide credentials just use an **ssh-agent**

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add /path/to/sshkey
```

## 

### Adding Docker Containers

If you wish to add another Dockerfile to the project make a **Dockerfile.toolname.tmp** file within the **docker_buildfiles** folder. Then opening up your **user_config** add a new section under the appropriate section as shown above in the  [docker](#Example Configurations For Docker Containers)

## Dependencies

- **Docker** required for any of the scanners to run

- **Python 3.6** required 

  - **Pipenv** for versioning of all Python packages. You can use the Pipfile with setup.py requirements as well.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/drrobot/
    pipenv install && pipenv shell
    python drrobot.py <command> <flags> target
    ```

    

- **Ansible** if you require the use of external servers.

- **Python Mattermost Driver** [Optional] if using Mattermost you will require this module

## Output

**Gather** : when ran will produce an output similar to:

```
ls -la  outputs/example.com

total 20
drwxrwxr-x  5 4096 Jul 30 09:24 .
drwxrwxr-x 16 4096 Jul 30 09:23 ..
drwxrwxr-x  2 4096 Jul 30 09:27 aggregated
drwxrwxr-x  2 4096 Jul 30 09:27 subfinder
drwxrwxr-x  2 4096 Jul 30 09:24 sublist3r

```

You will also notice a **sqlite** file found under the **dbs** folder (You can specify alternative db filenames):

```
ls -la dbs
drwxrwxr-x  2     4096 Jul 30 09:27 .
drwxrwxr-x 17     4096 Jul 30 11:10 ..
-rw-r--r--  1    16384 Jul 30 09:27 drrobot.db
```

**Inspect**: when ran will continue to add files to the output folder. If you provided a domain file under the db section the domain folder will be created for you. The output will look similar to the above but with some added contents:

```
ls -la output/example.com/eyewitness

total 4140
drwxr-xr-x 4 sasha sasha    4096 Dec  9  2018 .
drwxrwxr-x 7 sasha sasha    4096 Mar 19 13:49 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 sasha sasha 3009536 Dec  9  2018 ew.db

-rw-r--r-- 1 sasha sasha   39843 Dec  9  2018 report.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 sasha sasha   13692 Dec  9  2018 report_page10.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 sasha sasha   13776 Dec  9  2018 report_page11.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 sasha sasha   13742 Dec  9  2018 report_page12.html

```

### SQLite DB file schema

Table Data:
| domainid     | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY
| --------     | ------- |
| ip           | VARCHAR |
| hostname     | VARCHAR |
| headers      | VARCHAR |
| http_headers | TEXT    |
| https_headers| TEXT    |
| domain       | VARCHAR | FOREIGN KEY

Table Domain:
| domain       | VARCHAR | PRIMARY KEY
| --------     | ------- |

## Serve

As is often the case, having an API can be nice for automation purposes. Under the serve-api folder, there is a simple Django server implementation that you can stand up locally or serve via Docker. In order to serve the datak, you need to copy your database folder to the root directory of **serve-api** and rename the file to **drrobot.db**. If you would like to use an alternative name, simply change the name in the Django **serve____-api/drrobot/drrobot/settings.py**.
