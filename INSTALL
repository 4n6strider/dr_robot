## Pipenv
This tool has been made with Pipenv in mind. That being said you should easily be able to convert it to a virtualenv if you hate pipenv.

```
cd INSTALL_DIRECTORY
pipenv install && pipenv shell
```
Possible integration with pip in near future as cited in Pipenv docs: https://github.com/pypa/pipfile

## Virtualenv

```
cd INSTALL_DIRECTORY
virtualenv python3 env
. env/bin/activate
pip install  --requirements Pipfile
```
